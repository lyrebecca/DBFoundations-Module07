### Introduction
This assignment provided our class three prompts that ask us about high-level concepts regarding databases which are answered below. 

### Question 1: Explain when you would use a SQL UDF
SQL User Defined Functions (UDFs) would be used when a programmer would want to create a custom function. Also when you need an expression to return a single (scalar) value as an expression which views cannot do. 

### Question 2: Explain are the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
Scalar functions return a single value as an expression. Inline functions can only contain a single select statement where the select statement defines which columns are returned in the expression. Multi-statement functions are also known as table functions and needs to have a return statement which returns the declared table variable when called. 

### Summary
This assignment provided practice using functions within SQL server as well as created our own UDFs. Creating UDFs was simpler than I thought it would be but understanding how different functions are used alongside one another was a little difficult. The order of certain functions and when theyâ€™re executed took some time to understand.
